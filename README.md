//TODO Smooth fade-in image transitions and WebSocket updates

😤 Challenges We Faced (And Crushed)
1. 📉 WebSocket + Redux Integration
Getting real-time updates working in sync with Redux was tricky — state conflicts and re-renders were breaking the UI. We eventually set up a clean middleware-like layer to handle socket events smoothly. 💪

2. 🔀 API Rate Limits & Data Caching
We hit rate limits during development (especially NewsData.io). We introduced caching strategies and debounced calls to avoid over-fetching.
